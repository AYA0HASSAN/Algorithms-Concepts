# Algorithms-Concepts
Implementing Algorithmic Concepts With Python 
First File : Greedy => optimization for getting the min or max in the current step/situation
for understanding Greedy Alogrithm here a practical implementation 
1- Money Change : given a value of money and a list of Bank notes of specific country whatever get the min number of bank notes for that money value 
2- Zero/One Knapstack : collecting the max profite of items with values and weight to fill a predefined kanpstack weight under a condition 
                        take it or leave it which means take that you can take that item only as whole
3- Fractional Knapstack : the same as Zero/One Knapstack with different condition that you can take apart of an item to fill your knapstack

Second File : Search => implemnting different algorithms for Searching / Sorting / Recursive different concepts with different implementation
                        to optimize both Time and Space complexity
